Lately, I've been spending more time using software that I enjoy using, rather than big techs often cheapest, most convenient offering.

On that note, I've decided to spend more time on Codeberg, which is a really awesome project for open source development and code. I'm moving my blog over there too, so you can find more from me over in [Codeberg land](https://benrutter.codeberg.page/) from now on!

See you over there! ðŸ‘‹
