I'm a developer working in data and model ops. I produce generative art under the handle *houseofleft* and make small tools and software for my own use.

Here's some key projects I've written:

* [House of Left](https://github.com/benrutter/house-of-left): Generative art work and music
* [Shades](https://github.com/benrutter/shades): A 2d image creation library for python, with an api designed to make color/gradient work easy
* [Hop](https://github.com/benrutter/hop): A file browser for the command line that works with Windows, Apple and Linux
* [Boards](https://github.com/benrutter/boards): A recursive kanban tool for the terminal
* [Clamshell](https://github.com/benrutter/clamshell): An experimental, modern interactive shell
* [Mpy3](https://github.com/benrutter/mpy3): A very minimal music player CLI
* [Rad Waves](https://supercoolgames.itch.io/rad-waves): A web based surfing game
