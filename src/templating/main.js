      subtitle: 'A Python module for 2D generative image creation',
      link: 'https://github.com/benrutter/shades',
      description: 'Shades is a module for geometric image creation that expands on Python\'s Pillow and OpenSimplex packages. It\'s built on a paradigm of reusable Shade objects to help create generative 2D images. It simplifies production of generative images, and features an easily hackable abstract base class for expanding upon the code base whenever needed.'

      description: 'An exploration of the point where code and art intersect, House Of Left is an instagram-based project of artworks built using either Python or Processing (a Java framework designed for animations and visuals). Most of my stuff involves simple geometric patterns and colour rules.'

      subtitle: 'A terminal based file browser for Windows and Unix',
      link: 'https://github.com/benrutter/hop',
      description: `I use the terminal a lot in my workflow. Projects like Ranger and nnn are a huge help when working on Unix systems, but I\'m often required to use Windows. It bugged me that there wasn\'t an equivalent software, let alone one that offered cross-compatibility. So I built Hop, a Windows/Unix compatible file browser written in Python.`
