# Plan

All content written in markdown, and converted through script (pre-commit hook) into static website

Let's have two folders:

templating/
content/

absolute dream is that the header bar is based on folder structure?

and use jinja2 templates to generate everything.

I think in theory this should all be pretty easy?
